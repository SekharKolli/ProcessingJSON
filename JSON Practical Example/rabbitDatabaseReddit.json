She went on her own terms, in her own time, at home and surrounded by the ones she loved. However, my little Hicks who is also a Lionhead (neutered and roughly 5ish years old. Not 100% sure as he was a rescue) has been really struggling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;ve dealt with buns losing their mates before but nothing quite like this and was hoping &lt;a href=\"/r/rabbits\"&gt;/r/rabbits&lt;/a&gt; might be able to offer me their own stories or advice on how to help his poor little heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;THE ISSUE&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hicks was always a soft and gentle little rabbit. Ever since he joined the family he made these cute little noises which we call Beeps. He always chatted along in his beeps to us and Simba and was quite vocal. He had a rough start to life and was very malnourished which resulted in him not growing properly as a kit and his nose ended up a bit misshapen. I&amp;#39;ve heard rabbits make little squeaks before - but nothing like little Hicks, his are very loud! I have surmised that due to his nose problems it&amp;#39;s sort of become a little whistle which makes his beeps extra loud and extra cute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since we lost Simba, he has been very sad, of course. Quite often I&amp;#39;ll find him staring off into the void making these quiet little beeps which honestly sound like whimpers and is just absolutely devastating to hear because it sounds like he is crying. I do my best to comfort him and as soon as I give him cuddles and attention he stops. It seems to be something he does when he&amp;#39;s on his own. It might be for attention, or because he&amp;#39;s sad? Either way I&amp;#39;m doing my best to help him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other thing that has happened has he has developed a bit of a...short temper. He was never aggressive, or angry, and was always a really gentle sweet bunny. But since losing Simba he has bitten me a few times, snorted and generally shown signs of aggression and short tempered-ness that he has never displayed before. I know he is struggling and I would say a bit of anger is a logical reaction to grief but this is the first time I&amp;#39;ve ever seen it happen with one of my rabbits after the loss of their mate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have any of you ever had similar experiences with a widowing mate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would love some advice, thankyou!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I have been reading a lot from the house rabbit society of Missouri, watching videos and creeping around this subreddit. I&amp;#39;ve heard a lot regarding how critical their diet is to their health; about GI stasis and how even seemingly mild changes or stresses can precipitate a dire situation for a bunny. I know a rabbit-savvy vet and have extensively read up on how to prevent stasis with good diet and play time and how to deal with its onset, so I am not terribly worried about it-- *&lt;em&gt;I want to make sure I haven&amp;#39;t missed any information on this topic! :) *&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On to housing and space: My apartment has wood floors, so I know I am going to need cheap, cotton area rugs for the rabbit&amp;#39;s most-frequented areas, if not most of my place. I have an essentially empty room with no purpose as of now, so I am going to set up some rugs and a gate for the doorway and just let the little guy/girl romp around in there when they&amp;#39;re not in their hutch. Hutches are the next thing on my mind; I want to get a big rabbit, as I have heard they are a &lt;em&gt;tad&lt;/em&gt; more mellow and generally heartier, so I am already planning on giving the new bun a big home with space for a litter box and toys. On that note, does anyone have advice on how much the rabbits enjoy those rabbit-houses, or if they are essential to the rabbit&amp;#39;s temperment? You know- the ones that are like a little play-place that they can climb into/around x) Anyway, I think the rabbit&amp;#39;s hutch will stay in my bedroom (warmest room in the house), and I will have considerable space doe it in there as well as its play room, as I only have a few pieces of old, chewable furbiture. Please let me know if I&amp;#39;ve missed something here, as before :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general, I am going to rabbit-proof my place as best I can, which (due to the rather bare nature of my appartment) consists of tending to the wires behind my TV stand and computer desk (which share a corner I am going to block off with wood planks, or something similar, and seal/bind the cords with plastic sheaths).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have also familiarized myself with the other needs of a bun, such as how to treat it when it&amp;#39;s just arrived, how to hold it properly, how to litter-box train it and so forth, but I am open to hearing it all again in the hopes of being better prepared :)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I have missed anything, or have a misconception, please let me know!

The doctor said he can&amp;#39;t find anything wrong with him aside from having lost weight, which isn&amp;#39;t normal for a young bunny who got fixed recently, and he seems to sit in his urine frequently (I had no idea that wasn&amp;#39;t normal). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, my theories: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I was feeding him quite a bit of kale as part of his greens bc it doesn&amp;#39;t go bad as fast as other greens, but my vet (who by the way is one of the house rabbit society recommended ones) told me not to go heavy on the kale, so I am going to try to cut that out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Our full house is in the process of packing and splitting ways, so there are boxes all over the place and well, things aren&amp;#39;t normal. Maybe this is making him nervous? I should add, he&amp;#39;s been eating totally normally, all greens and hay and pellets with enthusiasm. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-The poor guy is lonely and depressed. I&amp;#39;ve tried to give him things to chew on, I&amp;#39;ve bought any variety of toys, I spend every evening in the living room with him, showing him affection, but maybe I can&amp;#39;t fill the void of another bunny? I hope this is the case bc I am planning on getting him a mate in a month or two once we are settled in our new place on our own. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the bald spot might be caused by him cleaning himself with paws that have his urine on them? My vet suggested a different bedding that I am going to start tonight so hopefully that won&amp;#39;t be such a thing anymore. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone else ever come into any issues like this with a young, seemingly healthy bunny? I will say, he&amp;#39;s been a little calmer than normal lately, but I figured that was the effect of months of post  neutering taking effect? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m open to ideas and experiences. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks rabbitors!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Ive had them since they were about 4 weeks old, but they are still much too scared to get pet by me or cuddle me at all.

I&amp;#39;d love to be able to pet and cuddle my girls, and i know not all rabbits like to be touched, but i just want to make sure I&amp;#39;m not doing anything that might be scaring them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything helps really!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR my 2 females rabbits that are 9months old are terrified of being pet by me.
